Semi-iterative motion
---------------------

 - Calculate planned foot position
    - Accelerometer's gravity reference
    - Stability triangle
        - with center of gravity changes

 - Attempt to place foot, halting once ground contact is made
    - Test accelerometer for floor impact detection(?)
    - Foot contact sensors

 - Develop vision software for detecting obstacles

 - Framework so this thing actually operates quickly enough

 - Set up code to properly deal with errors

Hardware
========

Current Board
-------------

 - RS-485 Long Packet Test
 - I2C Implementation
    - I/O Expander
    - Accelerometer
 - USB Fixes

Foot Sensors
------------

 - Solder
 - Assemble
 - Test

Revised Board
-------------

 - Footprint Check
	- Power Page
		- do214ab_SMC for D20 insufficiently wide
		- dual U10 on BOM?
		- missing barrel5_5 (J22), sot223-5 (U10) footprints
	- Battery Charger Page
		- D1 uses insufficiently wide SMB footprint... documentation seems to indicate SMB and do214aa_smb are the same, recommend a swap to it.  (do214aa doesn't seem to be the same as the other two... !?!)
	- USB/Ethernet Page
		- For the love of christ, rename USB_female to USB_B_female before I hurt you.  There are >10 different USB standards, including a very common A female.
		- missing ethernet (T1) footprint
 - Layout Check
	- Seperation of 3.3V plane underneath hub IC
	- Width of power trace to 3.3V regulator vs. width after.  (Go with thicker trace.)
	- Dual, but non parallel vias between usb ground and main ground don't help.
	- Check inner_power layer for strange overlaps...
	- What's going on with the vias?  They seem to go through many layers and perhaps touch them...  See under lan9512 in particular
